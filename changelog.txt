1) Moved the graph construction to a different function so graphs can be re-used. An existing graph can be passed to PCC. Check the new Xgraph option. pcc_buildgraph() can be called separately.
2) Seed usage changed. Now it uses two options. This allows negative seeds to be sent to the Mex version. Notice that the non-mex version uses Matlab rng() function which only allows non-negative seeds.

19/07/2022:
1) Options are now labeled arguments. Matlab R2019b or higher is required.
2) seed option to allow reproducibility. Default is no seed.
3) pccmex and pcc joined in a single function, an option is used to choose between them. Mex is the default one.

- Changed the stop criterion to be less conservative. It now considers the
amount of nodes, the amound of particles and also the amount of k-nearest 
neighbors in the graph construction to calculate how many iterations it 
should wait on the "stable" phase before it stops. k-nearest neighbors gives a
clue on how connected the network is, we usually need less "stable" iterations
in more connected networks.

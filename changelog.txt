- Changed the stop criterion to be less conservative. It now considers the
amount of nodes, the amound of particles and also the amount of k-nearest 
neighbors in the graph construction to calculate how many iterations it 
should wait on the "stable" phase before it stops. k-nearest neighbors gives a
clue on how connected the network is, we usually need less "stable" iterations
in more connected networks.

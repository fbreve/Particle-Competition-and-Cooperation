% Usage: pcc_graph = pcc_buildgraph(X, options)
% INPUT:
% X         - Matrix where each line is a data item and each column is an
%             attribute
% OPTIONS:
% k         - Each node is connected to its k-neirest neighbors. Default:
%             size of the dataset multiplied by 0.05.
% disttype  - Use 'euclidean', 'seuclidean', etc. Default: 'euclidean'
%
% OUTPUT:
% pcc_graph - structure containing KNN and knns
%             KNN is a matrix of neighbors, each line is a node, each
%             column is a neighbor.
%             knns is a vector where each element is the amount of
%             neighbors of a node.
